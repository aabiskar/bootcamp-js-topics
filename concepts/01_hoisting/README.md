# Hoisting

Hoisting in JavaScript is a process where interpreter moves the declared variables and functions on the top of the current execution scope and allocates memory to them before the actual code execution.

`var` declarations are hoisted and so is `let` and `const` but little differently than `var`. Unlike `var` declarations, `let` and `const` declaration exist inside something known as `temporal dead zone`
